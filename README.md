Toy Problem Challenges with JavaScript
This repository contains JavaScript solutions to three toy problem challenges. These challenges are designed to test your programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Below, you'll find details on each challenge and instructions on how to run the solutions.

Challenges
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Write a JavaScript function that calculates a student's grade based on their input marks. The grade is determined as follows:

A: Marks greater than 79
B: Marks between 60 and 79
C: Marks between 50 and 59
D: Marks between 40 and 49
E: Marks less than 40
How to Run
Open the grader.js file in your browser or a JavaScript environment.
Enter the student's marks when prompted.
The program will display the corresponding grade.
Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Write a JavaScript program that calculates demerit points for a car's speed violation. The program takes the car's speed as input and follows these rules:

Speed limit: 70 km/h
For every 5 km/h above the speed limit, the driver gets one demerit point.
If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, their license is suspended.
How to Run
Open the detector.js file in your browser or a JavaScript environment.
Enter the car's speed when prompted.
The program will display whether it's "Ok," the number of demerit points, or "License suspended."
Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Write a JavaScript program to calculate an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. The program also calculates various deductions, including payee, NHIF, and NSSF, using predefined rates.

How to Run
Open the calculator.js file in your browser or a JavaScript environment.
Enter the basic salary and benefits when prompted.
The program will display detailed salary information, including gross salary, deductions, and net salary.
